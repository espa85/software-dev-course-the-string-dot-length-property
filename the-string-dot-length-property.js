/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

*/

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = stringOne.length;   // Length of stringOne, s/b 15
let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;   // Length of stringTwo, s/b 10
let lengthThree = stringThree.length; // Length of stringThree, s/b 0

// Your code here
console.log("Length of stringOne:", lengthOne);     // log stringOne length
console.log("Length of stringTwo:", lengthTwo);     // log stringTwo length
console.log("Length of stringThree:", lengthThree); // log stringThree length
